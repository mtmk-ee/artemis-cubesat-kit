            Disconnecting power to the Raspberry Pi without shutting it down beforehand can cause the micro SD card containing the operating system to become corrupted. Unfortunately you probably won't be able to recover any data from the card. If you can't even connect to the Raspberry Pi from a desktop machine or laptop, you should try flashing its micro SD card with a fresh image.
